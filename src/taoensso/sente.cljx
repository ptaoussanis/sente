  "Channel sockets. Otherwise known as The Shiz.

      Protocol  | client>server | client>server + ack/reply | server>clientS[1] push
    * WebSockets:       ✓              [2]                          ✓  ; [3]
    * Ajax:            [4]              ✓                          [5] ; [3]

    [1] All of a user's (uid's) connected clients (browser tabs, devices, etc.).
    [2] Emulate with cb-uuid wrapping.
    [3] By uid only (=> logged-in users only).
    [4] Emulate with dummy-cb wrapping.
    [5] Emulate with long-polling against uid (=> logged-in users only).

  Special messages (implementation detail):
    * cb replies: :chsk/closed, :chsk/timeout, :chsk/error.
    * client-side events:
        [:chsk/handshake <#{:ws :ajax}>],
        [:chsk/ping      <#{:ws :ajax}>], ; Though no :ajax ping
        [:chsk/state [<#{:open :first-open :closed}> <#{:ws :ajax}]],
        [:chsk/recv  <`server>client`-event>]. ; Async event

    * server-side events:
       [:chsk/bad-edn <edn>],
       [:chsk/bad-event <chsk-event>],
       [:chsk/uidport-open  <#{:ws :ajax}>],
       [:chsk/uidport-close <#{:ws :ajax}>].

    * event wrappers: {:chsk/clj <clj> :chsk/dummy-cb? true} (for [2]),
                      {:chsk/clj <clj> :chsk/cb-uuid <uuid>} (for [4]).

  Implementation notes:
    * A server>client w/cb mechanism would be possible BUT:
      * No fundamental use cases. We can always simulate as server>client w/o cb,
        client>server w or w/o cb.
      * Would yield a significantly more complex code base.
      * Cb semantic is fundamentally incongruous with server>client since
        multiple clients may be connected simultaneously for a single uid.

  General-use notes:
    * Single HTTP req+session persists over entire chsk session but cannot
      modify sessions! Use standard a/sync HTTP Ring req/resp for logins, etc.
    * Easy to wrap standard HTTP Ring resps for transport over chsks. Prefer
      this approach to modifying handlers (better portability).

  Multiple clients (browser tabs, devices, etc.):
    * client>server + ack/reply: sends always to _single_ client. Note that an
      optional _multi_ client reply API wouldn't make sense (we're using a cb).
    * server>clientS push: sends always to _all_ clients.
    * Applications will need to be careful about which method is preferable, and
      when."
